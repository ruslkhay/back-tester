## OS

Our primary platform is Linux, but nothing prevents it to be built and run on other OS.
The following commands are for Linux users.
Other users are encouraged to add the corresponding instructions for required steps in this README.

## Build

Install dependencies once:

```
sudo apt install -y cmake g++
```

Build using cmake:

```
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build -j
```

or

```
mkdir -p build
pushd build
cmake ..
make -j VERBOSE=1
popd
```

## Test

To run unit tests:

```
ctest --test-dir build -j
```

or

```
pushd build
ctest -j
popd
```

or

```
build/bin/test/back-tester-tests
```

## Run

Back-tester:

```
build/bin/back-tester
```

## Contributing

Install PDM, create a virtual environment, and install the project dependencies:

```bash
curl -sSL https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | python3 -
pdm install
```

Then activate the virtual environment and set up the git pre-commit hooks:

```bash
eval $(pdm venv activate)
pre-commit install
```

After that, formatting and linting will run automatically before each commit.  
If the source code does not meet the required formatting rules, the hook will 
modify the files and stop the commit, and you will need to stage the updated 
changes manually.

To run formatting and linting yourself, use one of these commands:

```bash
pre-commit run --files file.py
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The current pre-commit hooks do the following:
- format and lint C++ code with `clang-format`;
- format and lint Python code with `ruff`;
- strip outputs from Jupyter notebooks.
